## If you want to help..
We would be more than happy if you can just use this and give feedbacks about experience, bugs, and what we can add to this app.

If you want to help with the code, here are some things you would need before this:
- We are using Tauri as the base for the application. So you would need [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), [Build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Recomended IDE with plugins are [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

With this setup, you can go to [issues](https://github.com/monntecc/lunaeditor/issues) and look for what you can do. Before commiting check if everything is working, and run `yarn run lint`
